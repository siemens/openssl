=head1 NAME

EVP_CIPHER-NULL - NULL encryption EVP_CIPHER implementation

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides support for NULL encryption using the B<EVP_CIPHER> API.
It simply copies the data without any encryption.

=head2 Algorithm Names

The default provider offers the following algorithms:

=over 4

=item "NULL"

=item "NULL-HMAC-SHA256" and "NULL-HMAC-SHA384"

=back

=head2 Parameters

The parameters supported by this implementation are detailed in
L<EVP_EncryptInit(3)/PARAMETERS>.

=head1 NOTES

"NULL" algorithm is used when the TLS cipher suite is TLS_NULL_WITH_NULL_NULL.
This does no encryption (just copies the data) and has a mac size of zero.
This conforms to RFC 5246 section-6.2.3.1.

"NULL-HMAC-SHA256" and "NULL-HMAC-SHA384" are used when the TLS cipher suite is
TLS_SHA256_SHA256 and TLS_SHA384_SHA384 respectively.
This conforms to RFC 9150.

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<provider-cipher(7)>, L<OSSL_PROVIDER-default(7)>

=head1 HISTORY

The NULL-HMAC-SHA256 and NULL-HMAC-SHA384 ciphers were added in OpenSSL version 3.3.
